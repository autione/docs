:::danger[Important plugin explaination]
**This is for the Discord Game SDK NOT the Embedded App SDK** <br/>
Any mention of "SDK" has nothing to do with making Discord voice channel activities. <br/>
Its only to display your game in a Discord user's profile with extra information and some other features.
:::

:::note[Discord Game SDK information]
The GameSDK's Achievements, Applications, Voice, Images, Lobbies, Networking, Storage, and Store (purchases and discounts) features have been deprecated and will not be added. <br /> However the rest is and will still be supported by Discord.
:::
<br />
:::tip[Keep in mind] 
To make anything work in the plugin make sure to run
```gdscript
func _process(_delta):
    DiscordRPC.run_callbacks()
```

This happens normaly inside the Autoload wich should be automatically added by the plugin. <br />
Something that does **not get added automatically** is your `app_id`. It is also mandatory to be able to use anything in the plugin.

```gdscript
DiscordRPC.app_id = #<your Application ID>
```

## Quick start

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Recommended">
    <Steps>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the AssetLib tab in your Godot Editor.</li>
        <li>
          Search for "discord" and install all the files from this plugin
          <img width="30px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaporvee/discord-rpc-godot/main/project/assets/Logo_V2_Clyde.png"/>
        </li>
        <LastQuickSteps />
      </ol>
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Manual">
    <Steps>
      <ol>
        <li>
        <DownloadBtn label="Download the addon" href="https://github.com/vaporvee/discord-rpc-godot/releases/latest/download/ADDON-discord-rpc-godot.zip/" /><br/>
        </li>
        <li>
		Copy the folder from the zip file to the root of your Godot project like the following
		<FileTree>
		- **addons/**
		  - **discord-rpc-gd/** should contain this folder with these files
		    - bin/
			- nodes/
		    - ...
		    - plugin.cfg
		    - plugin.gd
		    - ...
		    - restart_window.tscn
		    - ...
		- …
		- icon.svg
		- project.godot
		</FileTree>
		</li>
        <LastQuickSteps />
      </ol>
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```gdscript 
extends Node
func _ready():
DiscordRPC.app_id = 1099618430065324082 # Application ID
DiscordRPC.details = "A demo activity by vaporvee"
DiscordRPC.state = "Checkpoint 23/23"
DiscordRPC.large_image = "example_game" # Image key from "Art Assets"
DiscordRPC.large_image_text = "Try it now!"
DiscordRPC.small_image = "boss" # Image key from "Art Assets"
DiscordRPC.small_image_text = "Fighting the end boss! D:"

DiscordRPC.start_timestamp = int(Time.get_unix_time_from_system()) # "02:46 elapsed"
# DiscordRPC.end_timestamp = int(Time.get_unix_time_from_system()) + 3600 # +1 hour in unix time / "01:00:00 remaining"

DiscordRPC.refresh() # Always refresh after changing the values!
```
**Then it will look similar to this:**

## Troubleshooting
First of all try reinstalling the plugin and restart both your Godot Editor and your Discord client.
<details><summary><b>I have no errors in my Godot console from the plugin but my Activity doesn't show up in my Discord Client.</b></summary>Make sure a `DiscordSDK.run_callbacks()` function runs in a `_process(delta)` function. This should happen in the Autoload added by the plugin. If it still doesn't help, try the Demo above. If still nothing appears in your Discord profile card, you have to reset the depending settings in you Discord or reinstall it.</details>
<details>
<summary><b>I have a lot of `DiscordSDK not declared` errors spammed in my Godot Console and i can't use the plugin.</b></summary> Make sure the plugin is actually enabled. Then the plugin should work and after the second restart you shouldn't get any errors from the plugin. But if it still gives you the errors delete this `.gdignore` file in your file explorer (will not be shown in the Godot Editor)
<FileTree>
- addons/
  - discord-rpc-gd/
	- bin/
      - **.gdignore**
  	- …
- …
- icon.svg
- project.godot
</FileTree>
and restart the editor manually.
</details>
